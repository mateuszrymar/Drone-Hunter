## What is this game about?
  You're a hunter in a post-apocalyptic world that was taken over by the AI. Use your machine bow to kill robots and clean your tribe's territory.

## How I worked on this project

My goal for this project was to apply concepts learned in a JavaScript tutorial in my first larger personal project.
  - First I built a very simple prototype - the player could shoot squares at a target in 3D space with a fixed camera.
  - When that worked, I playtested the game, fixed bugs, added a scoring system.
  - I decided the game was worth polishing, so I started to think about art direction and created moodboards.
  - I've drawn pixel-art game elements in Photoshop.
  - Added crude animations to improve User Experience.
  - Programmed 3 different game modes.
    
## Interesting features
  - No libraries used: it's all organic, homegrown, dirty junior code.
  - I built a series of complex functions to transform user input into 3D space and back.
  - I built a simple physics calculation that simulates arrow flight.
  - All assets (excluding sound) were hand-crafted by me.
    
## Challenges I was faced with
  - Loops, scope - JavaScript 101.
  - Testing.
  - Dealing with a large codebase.
  - DOM manipulation.

## Why I built the project this way
  This was my first personal project in vanilla JavaScript (I'm not counting tutorial projects).
  I learnt a lot while working on this project, but overall structure could be much cleaner if I were to write it once again.

## If I had more time, I'd do this:
  - Separate JS code into a few modules, do a major refactoring.
  - Create animations.
  - Add a few levels with increasing difficulty.
  - Add a shop with upgrades to create progression.
  - Add a leaderboard to increase player engagement.
  - Optimize performance.
